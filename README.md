# MichaelDuanKitchenStrikeCode
A copy of the source code for Kitchen Strike  and The Courtyard . All of the source code was written by me, Michael Duan.


Kitchen Strike: (http://blog.kitchenstrike.com/)
This is a small summer project. I intended to go back and clean up all the code and replace interfaces with a component based system and add more classes server-side as opposed to a glob of code in the GameMode class. In particular, the code for player to object interaction is kind of nasty. Also, this is in Unreal Engine 4 so there are a decent number of calls to Blueprint scripts for UI/animations. Still, I decided to showcase this project because I was the sole contributor to the project and it had a good amount of typical AAA game features. It is an online multiplayer game, but it uses the default UE4 networking model instead of custom networking with C++ sockets.


The Courtyard: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jge6C8rBHMY)
I included some source code that I wrote for the prototype of The Courtyard, a prospective Advanced Games Project at the University of Southern California. I included this because I wanted to show that I usually write much cleaner object-oriented code for non-hobby projects since it'll be read by a team of people and will be easier to work on in terms of source control because different gameplay elements are separated into more files.
