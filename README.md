# MichaelDuanKitchenStrikeCode
A copy of the source code for Kitchen Strike (http://blog.kitchenstrike.com/) by Michael Duan.

I intended to go back and clean up all the code and replace interfaces with a component based system and add more classes server-side as opposed to a glob of code in the GameMode class. In particular, the code for player to object interaction is kind of nasty. Also, this is in Unreal Engine 4 so there are a decent number of calls to Blueprint scripts for UI/animations.

I, Michael Duan, am the sole contributor to this project.
